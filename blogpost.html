                <h1 class="blog-post_title">Remote Work Tips</h1>
                <p>Recently many companies are adopting remote work polices to avoid the fast spreading of the coronavirus, also called COVID-19, 
                    on the office. But it is not easy at all to develop that fast a culture that supports effective remote work. Since I’ve spent 
                    3 years working 100% from home, I’ll try to collect here some tips that helped me and my teams to have very productive work 
                    during this time!
                </p>

                <h1 class="blog-post_title">Your work environment</h1>
                <p>It’s easy to assume that, while working from home you can basically sit in bed, in front of the TV, or in the kitchen table… 
                    well, I can assure you that it doesn’t work at all!!
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>If you intend to work for more than a couple hours, it is a game-changer to set up a proper environment, <strong> at the very least
                         a proper desk and chair</strong>, where you can sit for the day without needing physiotherapy after.</li>
                    <li>Other accessories that will help a lot: external monitor, keyboard and mouse and the most important one: <strong>a good headset!!</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>You will also need a <strong> internet connection</strong> and energy supply, that’s usually available in our homes, but you can see 
                        that remote work is not exactly working from anywhere.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h1 class="blog-post_title">Communication</h1>
                <p>It is a myth that doing home-office the communication between teams is worse, in fact, It can become even better because we 
                    need to make sure all information is available to everyone at any time!
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>EMAIL:</strong> Asynchronous communication and Informations (I don’t expect an answer soon or at all)
                        ex: I need to inform my whole team about an update in our monitoring tool.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>SLACK:</strong> Synchronous communication but not urgent, questions, reminders, and notifications (I expect an answer soon or that 
                        people will get notified)
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>GOOGLE MEET:</strong> Synchronous and more urgent communication or long topics
                        ex: A talk about a test is getting big in slack, it is already difficult to keep a context and the channel is flooded: time to move to a call!
                        ex: I need to align a rule change between me and other 3 people, most probably a quick call will be faster than other tools.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h1 class="blog-post_title">Work-life balance</h1>
                <p>Another myth about remote work is that you work less, in my experience is very easy to end up working way more than in the office, and you need to 
                    pay attention to avoid working extra hours in an inefficient way or mixing your working time with personal time.
                </p>

                <p>My main tips to help with that:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Have a separated work environment,</strong> It is very important to have a clear separation of what is the workplace, and the resting 
                        place in your home, if there is no specific room for that available, try to organize at least a desk that is exclusive for work.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Have clear working hours and routine,</strong> try to start and stop working around the same time every day, that is important not only
                        to separate concerns but also for your team to know when to find you online.
                        Some people even like to have a work start ritual, like changing to work clothes, pouring some coffee, etc.. find what works best for you.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Inform your partner and family members about your working hours,</strong> and that during this time you are not available, just like if
                        you were out to the office. Having a separate working space will also help a lot to make this clear.
                    </li>
                </ol>
