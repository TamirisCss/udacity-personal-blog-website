                <h1 class="blog-post_title">Thailand</h1>
                <p>Located in the heart of mainland Southeast Asia, Thailand is a country of mountains, hills,
                    plains and a long coastline along the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman, not including the 
                    coastlines of some 400 islands, most of them in the Andaman Sea. Thailand encompasses 
                    diverse ecosystems, including the hilly forested areas of the northern frontier, the fertile
                    rice fields of the central plains, the broad plateau of the northeast, and the rugged coasts 
                    along the narrow southern peninsula.
                </p>

                <h1 class="blog-post_title">Ko Phi Phi</h1>
                <p>There’s quite a selection of things to do in Phi Phi, even on the archipelago's tiniest 
                    islands. The larger of the Phi Phi islands are ringed by beautiful beaches and private 
                    bays. Above the azure seas, you have striking limestone cliffs, white sands and nodding 
                    palms. Below, there’s colourful coral reefs and vibrant sea life.

                    There are very few manmade attractions on Phi Phi. It’s mostly all about the natural 
                    beauty of this amazing part of Thailand. Check out what to do in Phi Phi below:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Bamboo Island</strong> ('Koh Phai' in Thai) is one of the 6 islands belonging to the Phi Phi
                         archipelago in the southern Thai province of Krabi. Approximately 5 km northeast of
                          Koh Phi Phi Don, it's a tropical dream come true.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Viking Cave</strong> is one of the most notable sites on Koh Phi Phi Leh, located at the bottom 
                        of a tall limestone cliff on the north-eastern side of the island. It takes roughly 30
                        minutes to get there by long-tail boat from Tonsai Bay (the main pier in Phi Phi Islands). 
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Diving</strong> is one of the prime activities in Phi Phi. The island counts a large number 
                        of serious and professional PADI dive centres dispensing courses – from Discover Scuba
                        Diving to Divemaster – and day trips to the many world-class dive sites available in 
                        and around Phi Phi's waters.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Phiphi viewpoint</strong> Phi Phi Viewpoint is one of the most popular landmarks on Koh Phi Phi Don. This large island 
                        has an unusual shape – like an ‘H’ – with its main village built on the horizontal bar, a 100-metre
                        flat strip of sand between Dalum Bay to the north and Tonsai Bay to the south.  You can find the 
                        viewpoint to the east of the flat strip of sand and overlooks the village and the 2 bays.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h1 class="blog-post_title">Chiang Mai</h1>
                <p>Chiang Mai is a land of misty mountains and colourful hill tribes, a playground for seasoned travellers,
                    a paradise for shoppers and a delight for adventurers. On a trip to Chiang Mai, the curious traveller can
                    expand their horizons with Thai massage and cooking courses. Others will be bowled over by the variety of
                    handicrafts and antiques. The wild child will find plenty of lively nightlife, and the epicure can indulge
                    in wonderful cuisine. Despite its relatively small size, Chiang Mai truly has it all. Check out what to do
                    in Phi Phi below:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Elephant Jungle Sanctuary</strong> is as one of the best elephant sanctuaries in Chiang Mai as our 
                        track record of sustainable and ethical treatment speaks for itself. Our elephant reserve in Chiang Mai has many 
                        options for visitors to experience the wonderful elephants of Thailand. 
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Wat Phra Singh</strong> is the most popular temple in Chiang Mai according to visitor numbers. Mainly this
                        is because it houses the city’s most important Buddha image, the Lion Buddha, which you can see in a small chapel
                        at the rear of the complex, next to the golden chedi.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Chiang Mai Night Bazaar</strong> An epicentre of shopping in Chiang Mai, the huge Night Bazaar runs every
                        evening from 18:00 to 22:30. Defining where this market begins and ends is not easy, as the collection of stalls 
                        and shops does vary; head to intersection of Chang Khlan Road and Loi Khro Road and you’ll be roughly in the middle, 
                        with the bazaar spreading out for about two blocks in every direction. The market offers pretty much everything any 
                        other Thai night market has, just more of it; this means fake football shirts, carved elephants, artwork, handicrafts, 
                        sunglasses, DVDs, shoes, luggage, furniture, and homeware
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h1 class="blog-post_title">Bangkok</h1>
                <p>Bangkok welcomes more visitors than any other city in the world and it doesn’t take long to realise why. Bangkok is a city
                    of contrasts with action at every turn. Marvel at the gleaming temples, catch a tuk tuk through bustling Chinatown or take
                    a longtail boat through floating markets. Food is another Bangkok highlight, from local dishes served at humble street stalls 
                    to haute cuisine at romantic rooftop restaurants.
                </p>

                <p>Check out what to do in Bangkok below:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>The Grand Palece:</strong> Home to the famous reclining Buddha and massage school. The Royal family doesn’t 
                        live in the palace (it’s only used for official state functions) and you can’t go into any of the buildings, but 
                        wandering the grounds and open temples is worth the visit. It’s beautiful and the craftsmanship in the architecture 
                        is amazing. Go first thing in the morning to avoid the crowds.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>our all the temples: </strong> Bangkok has a lot of beautiful temples. Hire a tuk-tuk driver to take you 
                        around for the day to see the temples. Just make sure he doesn’t take you shopping along the way — drivers get 
                        kickbacks if they bring customers into certain shops.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Visit Khao San Road:</strong> This road (along with Soi Rambuttri) in Bangkok is a must visit! You’ll find 
                        endless bars, shops, street food, international restaurants, vendors, locals, and activity all day and all night. 
                        It’s also a popular spot on the weekend for Thais. I personally like the quieter Soi Rambuttri, but Khao San is an 
                        awesome place to sit outside and meet other travelers. Be sure to visit Brick Bar, the hidden-away Thai ska bar where
                        only locals go.
                    </li>
